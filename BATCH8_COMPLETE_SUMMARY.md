# Batch 8: Progress Tracking System - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## üéâ Implementation Summary

Batch 8 (Progress Tracking) has been successfully implemented with comprehensive backend services, API endpoints, database schema, cron jobs, and complete frontend component documentation.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema

**New Models Created:**
- `StudentProgress` - Tracks overall student progress per class
- `AssignmentProgress` - Tracks individual assignment progress for each student
- `ConceptMasteryPath` - Defines concept prerequisites and learning paths (teacher-customizable)
- `LearningVelocityLog` - Historical learning velocity tracking (weekly logs)

**Model Enhancements:**
- Updated `ConceptMastery` with progression fields:
  - `lastPracticed`
  - `practiceCount`
  - `improvementRate`
  - `suggestedNextConcepts`
  - `remediationNeeded`

**Migration:** `20251024142227_add_progress_tracking_system`

### 2. Backend Services

**File:** [socratit-backend/src/services/progress.service.ts](socratit-backend/src/services/progress.service.ts)

**Core Functions:**
- `calculateStudentProgress()` - Real-time progress calculation after each assignment
- `updateAssignmentProgress()` - Updates assignment progress when students interact
- `updateAssignmentTimeSpent()` - Tracks time spent with 5-minute updates from frontend
- `updateConceptMastery()` - Updates concept mastery based on question responses
- `calculateWeeklyVelocity()` - Weekly cron job to calculate learning velocity
- `getSuggestedNextConcepts()` - Recommends next concepts based on learning paths
- `getStudentProgressAcrossClasses()` - Progress across all enrolled classes
- `getClassProgressOverview()` - Teacher view of all student progress

**Key Features:**
- Real-time progress calculation (not batch processed)
- 25% velocity drop triggers teacher alerts
- Mastery < 60% flags concepts for remediation
- Trend calculation (improving/stable/declining) with 5% threshold
- WebSocket events for real-time frontend updates

### 3. API Endpoints

**File:** [socratit-backend/src/routes/progress.routes.ts](socratit-backend/src/routes/progress.routes.ts)
**Controller:** [socratit-backend/src/controllers/progress.controller.ts](socratit-backend/src/controllers/progress.controller.ts)

#### Student Progress Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/progress/student/:studentId/class/:classId` - Get student progress for a class
- `GET /api/v1/progress/student/:studentId/classes` - Get progress across all classes
- `GET /api/v1/progress/class/:classId/students` - Get class progress (teachers only)
- `POST /api/v1/progress/calculate/:studentId/:classId` - Trigger progress calculation

#### Assignment Progress Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/progress/assignments/:studentId` - Get all assignment progress (with filters)
- `GET /api/v1/progress/assignment/:assignmentId/student/:studentId` - Get specific assignment progress
- `GET /api/v1/progress/assignment/:assignmentId/students` - Get progress for all students (teachers only)
- `PATCH /api/v1/progress/assignment/:assignmentId/time` - Update time spent (rate-limited: 1 per minute)

#### Concept Mastery Progress Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/progress/concepts/:studentId/class/:classId` - Get concept mastery for student
- `GET /api/v1/progress/concepts/:conceptName/students/:classId` - Get class concept mastery (teachers only)

#### Concept Path Management (Teachers Only)

#### Learning Velocity Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/progress/velocity/:studentId/class/:classId` - Get student velocity (with date range)
- `GET /api/v1/progress/velocity/class/:classId` - Get class velocity (teachers only)

#### Progress Trends Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/progress/trends/:studentId/class/:classId` - Get student trends
- `GET /api/v1/progress/trends/class/:classId` - Get class trends (teachers only)

**Security:**
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Role-based access control (students can only view own data)
- Teachers can only access their own classes
- Time tracking rate-limited to prevent manipulation
- Multi-tenancy filtering on all queries

### 4. WebSocket Integration

**File:** [socratit-backend/src/services/websocket.service.ts](socratit-backend/src/services/websocket.service.ts)

**New Events Added:**
- `progress:updated` - Emitted when student progress is recalculated
- `assignment:progress` - Emitted when assignment progress changes
- `concept:mastery` - Emitted when concept mastery changes significantly (>10%)
- `velocity:alert` - Emitted to teachers when student velocity drops >25%

**Recipients:**
- Students receive their own progress updates
- Teachers receive updates for all students in their classes
- Real-time synchronization across devices

### 5. Cron Jobs

**File:** [socratit-backend/src/jobs/velocity.cron.ts](socratit-backend/src/jobs/velocity.cron.ts)

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at midnight (00:00)

**Function:** Calculates weekly learning velocity for all active students
- Counts assignments completed in the past week
- Calculates velocity (assignments/week)
- Compares to previous week (tracks velocity change)
- Triggers alerts if velocity drops >25%
- Updates `StudentProgress` records
- Creates `LearningVelocityLog` entries

**Initialized in:** [socratit-backend/src/index.ts](socratit-backend/src/index.ts:56)
