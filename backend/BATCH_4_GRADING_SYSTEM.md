## üéØ What Was Built

### Backend Implementation (100% Complete)

#### 1. Database Schema (2 New Models + 1 Enum)

**New Enum:**
- `LetterGrade`: A_PLUS, A, A_MINUS, B_PLUS, B, B_MINUS, C_PLUS, C, C_MINUS, D_PLUS, D, D_MINUS, F

**New Models:**

1. **GradeCategory**: Defines grading categories for classes
   - Category details (name, weight percentage)
   - Drop lowest N scores option
   - Late penalty configuration (per day, max penalty)
   - Extra credit support
   - Display order for UI
   - Soft deletes

2. **Grade**: Stores calculated grades for students
   - Three types: assignment, category, overall
   - Points earned/possible and percentage
   - Letter grade conversion
   - Weighted scores for categories
   - Grade adjustments (extra credit, late penalty, curve)
   - Drop status tracking
   - Teacher comments
   - Historical tracking with timestamps

#### 2. Grade Calculation Service (Complete)

**Core Functions:**
- `calculateStudentGrade()` - Calculates overall grade with weighted categories
- `saveStudentGrades()` - Saves category and overall grades to database
- `saveAssignmentGrade()` - Saves individual assignment grades
- `applyCurveToClass()` - Applies curve to all students in a class
- `getGradeDistribution()` - Returns letter grade distribution
- `percentageToLetterGrade()` - Converts percentage to letter grade

**Features:**
- Weighted category calculations (0-100% per category)
- Drop lowest N scores per category
- Automatic letter grade conversion (A+ to F scale)
- Late penalty application
- Extra credit handling
- Curve adjustments (positive or negative)
- Grade normalization when weights don't sum to 100%
- Handles empty categories gracefully

#### 3. API Endpoints (8 Total)

**Grade Retrieval:**
- `GET /api/v1/grades/student/:studentId/class/:classId` - Get student's grades for a class
- `GET /api/v1/grades/class/:classId` - Get all students' grades in class (teacher only)
- `GET /api/v1/grades/student/:studentId` - Get student's grades across all classes
- `GET /api/v1/grades/student/:studentId/history` - Get historical grade data

**Grade Categories:**
- `POST /api/v1/grades/categories` - Create/update grade categories for a class
- `GET /api/v1/grades/categories/:classId` - Get grade categories for a class

**Analytics:**
- `GET /api/v1/grades/class/:classId/distribution` - Get grade distribution (A's, B's, etc.)

**Grade Adjustments:**
- `POST /api/v1/grades/class/:classId/curve` - Apply curve to class grades

#### 4. Business Logic

**Grade Calculation Algorithm:**
1. Fetch all graded submissions for student in class
2. Group submissions by category (based on assignment type)
3. For each category:
   - Get all percentage scores
   - Sort and drop lowest N scores (if configured)
   - Calculate category average
   - Apply category weight
4. Sum weighted category scores
5. Normalize if weights don't total 100%
6. Convert to letter grade
7. Save to database with timestamps

**Grade Type Mapping:**
- HOMEWORK ‚Üí "Homework" category
- QUIZ ‚Üí "Quizzes" category
- TEST ‚Üí "Tests" category
- PRACTICE ‚Üí "Practice" category
- CHALLENGE ‚Üí "Challenges" category

**Letter Grade Scale:**
- A+: 97-100%
- A: 93-96%
- A-: 90-92%
- B+: 87-89%
- B: 83-86%
- B-: 80-82%
- C+: 77-79%
- C: 73-76%
- C-: 70-72%
- D+: 67-69%
- D: 63-66%
- D-: 60-62%
- F: Below 60%

#### 5. Integration with Batch 3

**Automatic Grade Saving:**
- When student submits assignment (`submitAssignment` controller):
  - Assignment grade saved automatically
  - Category grades recalculated
  - Overall class grade updated
  - All changes timestamped

**Grade Records:**
- **Assignment grades**: Created when submission is graded
- **Category grades**: Updated whenever assignment grades change
- **Overall grades**: Recalculated after category changes

## üìä Database Changes

### Migration: `add_grading_system`
- Added 1 new enum (13 values)
- Added 2 new models (28 total fields)
- Added 15+ indexes for performance
- Added foreign key constraints to User, Class, Assignment
- Updated existing models with new relations

### Key Indexes:
- `grade.studentId`, `grade.classId`, `grade.schoolId`
- `grade.assignmentId`, `grade.gradeType`, `grade.categoryName`
- `grade.gradeDate` (for historical queries)
- `gradeCategory.classId`, `gradeCategory.schoolId`

---

## üîê Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization:
- JWT authentication required on all endpoints
- Role-based access control:
  - **Students**: View only their own grades
  - **Teachers**: View and manage grades for their classes only
  - **Admins**: (Reserved for future)
- Multi-tenant data isolation (schoolId filtering)
- Enrollment verification for student access
- Class teacher verification for teacher access

### Data Protection:
- All grades tied to schoolId (multi-tenancy)
- Audit logging for all grade operations
- IP address and user agent tracking
- FERPA/COPPA compliant architecture

### Rate Limiting:
- Standard endpoints: 100 req/15min
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage

## üéì Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Three-Tier Grade Structure**
- **Assignment grades**: Individual assignment scores
- **Category grades**: Aggregated by assignment type (homework, quizzes, tests)
- **Overall grades**: Weighted combination of all categories

### 2. **Flexible Category Weighting**
- Teachers define custom categories with any weights
- System normalizes if weights don't sum to 100%
- Supports traditional grading schemes (40% tests, 30% homework, etc.)

### 3. **Drop Lowest Scores**
- Configurable per category
- Helps students by removing worst performances
- Common in education (drop 2 lowest homeworks)

### 4. **Automatic Recalculation**
- Grades updated immediately when submissions graded
- Category grades recalculated automatically
- Overall grade updates cascade from categories

### 5. **Letter Grade Conversion**
- Standard A-F scale with +/- modifiers
- Percentage-based conversion (97+ = A+, etc.)
- Consistent across platform

### 6. **Historical Tracking**
- All grade changes timestamped
- Complete audit trail
- Supports trend analysis
