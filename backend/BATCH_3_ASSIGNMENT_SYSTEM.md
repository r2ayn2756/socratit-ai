## üéØ What Was Built

### Backend Implementation (100% Complete)

#### 1. Database Schema (6 New Models + 4 Enums)

**New Enums:**
- `AssignmentType`: PRACTICE, QUIZ, TEST, HOMEWORK, CHALLENGE
- `AssignmentStatus`: DRAFT, SCHEDULED, ACTIVE, CLOSED, ARCHIVED
- `QuestionType`: MULTIPLE_CHOICE, FREE_RESPONSE
- `SubmissionStatus`: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, SUBMITTED, GRADED

**New Models:**
1. **Assignment**: Main assignment entity with metadata, scheduling, settings, and AI generation tracking
   - 25+ fields including title, type, status, points, due dates, settings
   - Supports time limits, max attempts, late submissions, answer shuffling
   - Tracks AI generation metadata

2. **Question**: Individual questions within assignments
   - Supports both multiple choice (4 options) and free response
   - Stores correct answers for instant grading
   - Includes rubrics for AI grading of free response
   - Tracks concepts and difficulty for analytics

3. **Submission**: Student's submission for an entire assignment
   - Tracks attempt number, timing, scores, and status
   - Calculates percentage and tracks late submissions
   - Stores teacher feedback and notes

4. **Answer**: Individual answer to a question
   - Stores student's answer (selected option or text)
   - Tracks grading results (correct/incorrect, points earned)
   - Supports both AI grading and manual teacher override
   - Records AI confidence levels

5. **AnalyticsEvent**: Comprehensive event tracking
   - Records all student interactions with assignments
   - Flexible JSON data field for event-specific information
   - Enables detailed analytics and insights

#### 2. AI Integration (Complete OpenAI Integration)

**AI Quiz Generation Service:**
- Generates complete quizzes from curriculum text
- Creates multiple choice and free response questions
- Assigns point values and difficulty levels
- Returns structured JSON with questions and answers
- Error handling and retry logic

**AI Grading Service:**
- Grades free response answers using OpenAI
- Provides detailed feedback and suggestions
- Returns confidence scores
- Handles errors gracefully with fallback to manual grading

**Features:**
- Configurable number of questions (1-50)
- Mixing question types
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, mixed)
- Subject and grade level aware
- Stores AI prompts for audit trail

#### 3. API Endpoints (16 Total)

**Assignment Endpoints (7):**
- `POST /api/v1/assignments` - Create assignment
- `POST /api/v1/assignments/generate` - Generate quiz with AI
- `GET /api/v1/assignments` - Get all assignments (filtered by role)
- `GET /api/v1/assignments/:id` - Get single assignment
- `PATCH /api/v1/assignments/:id` - Update assignment
- `DELETE /api/v1/assignments/:id` - Delete (soft delete)
- `POST /api/v1/assignments/:id/publish` - Publish assignment

**Submission Endpoints (6):**
- `POST /api/v1/submissions/start` - Start assignment
- `GET /api/v1/submissions` - Get all submissions
- `GET /api/v1/submissions/:id` - Get single submission
- `POST /api/v1/submissions/:id/answers` - Submit answer (with instant grading)
- `POST /api/v1/submissions/:id/submit` - Submit assignment
- `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/:id/answers/:answerId/grade` - Override grade (teacher)

#### 4. Business Logic

**Assignment Creation Workflow:**
1. Teacher creates assignment with metadata
2. Add questions (manually or via AI generation)
3. Set due dates, time limits, and settings
4. Publish immediately or schedule for later
5. Students notified when published (ready for Batch 6)

**AI Quiz Generation Workflow:**
1. Teacher provides curriculum text (50-10,000 chars)
2. Configure quiz parameters (type, difficulty, # questions)
3. AI generates structured quiz with correct answers
4. Teacher can review and edit before publishing
5. Quiz saved as draft for modification

**Student Assignment Workflow:**
1. Student opens assignment (creates submission)
2. Answer questions one at a time
3. Receive instant feedback after each answer
   - Multiple choice: Immediate correct/incorrect
   - Free response: AI grades and provides feedback
4. Submit assignment when complete
5. View final grade and detailed feedback

**Grading Workflow:**
- **Multiple Choice**: Instant automatic grading
- **Free Response**: AI grading with OpenAI
  - Compares to reference answer and rubric
  - Provides score (0-1), feedback, and confidence
  - Falls back to manual grading on AI error
- **Teacher Override**: Teachers can adjust any grade
- **Final Score**: Calculated automatically from all answers

**Analytics Tracking:**
- Every student action tracked (assignment_opened, question_viewed, answer_submitted, etc.)
- Timestamps for all events
- IP address and user agent logged
- Flexible JSON data for event-specific information

#### 5. Security & Middleware

**New Middleware:**
- `requireAssignmentOwner`: Verify teacher created assignment
- `requireAssignmentAccess`: Verify access (teacher or enrolled student)
- `requireSubmissionAccess`: Verify submission ownership
- `requireClassTeacherForAssignment`: Verify teacher teaches the class
- `validateRequest`: Joi validation for all requests

**Security Features:**
- Multi-tenant data isolation (schoolId filtering)
- Role-based access control (TEACHER/STUDENT)
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Rate limiting (100 req/15min standard, 10 req/15min for AI)
- Input validation with Joi schemas
- Audit logging for all operations

#### 6. Validators (Comprehensive Joi Schemas)

**Assignment Validators:**
- `createAssignmentValidator`: 15+ fields with validation
- `updateAssignmentValidator`: Partial updates
- `publishAssignmentValidator`: Publish settings
- `generateQuizValidator`: AI generation parameters
- `getAssignmentsQueryValidator`: Query filters

**Question Validators:**
- `addQuestionValidator`: Multiple choice or free response
- `updateQuestionValidator`: Question modifications

**Submission Validators:**
- `startAssignmentValidator`: Assignment ID
- `submitAnswerValidator`: Answer data
- `bulkSubmitAnswersValidator`: Multiple answers at once
- `submitAssignmentValidator`: Final submission

**Grading Validators:**
- `overrideGradeValidator`: Manual grade override
- `addTeacherFeedbackValidator`: Teacher feedback
