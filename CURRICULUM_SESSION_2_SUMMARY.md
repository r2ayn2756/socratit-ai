## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### 1. AI Provider Strategy
- Primary: Claude (Anthropic) - Best for structured output
- Fallback: OpenAI GPT-3.5 - Wide availability
- Support: Gemini - Alternative option
- All wrapped in single `callAI()` function for easy switching

### 2. Date Handling
- Store dates as Date objects in database
- ISO strings in API (JSON serialization)
- Calculate instructional days (exclude weekends)
- Buffer weeks for flexibility (2-4 weeks)
- Future: Support for custom break dates

### 3. Unit Topic Structure
- JSON field for flexibility
- Nested: topics → subtopics → concepts → objectives
- Allows rich content without rigid schema
- Easy to extend in future
- Searchable with Prisma JSON operators

### 4. Progress Calculation
- Scheduled: Calculate on-demand (not real-time)
- Triggered by: assignment submission, manual update
- Cached in database: `percentComplete` field
- Updates propagate: unit → schedule → class
- Efficient for large classes

### 5. Teacher Control Philosophy
- AI suggests, teacher decides
- Never auto-apply AI changes
- Show confidence scores for transparency
- Allow complete override of AI
- Track what's AI-generated vs teacher-modified

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### TypeScript Enum Mismatch
- **Problem:** Comparing UnitStatus enum to string literal "COMPLETED"
- **Solution:** Explicit type checking for each enum value
- **Location:** `curriculumSchedule.service.ts:592`
- **Status:** Fixed ✅

### Prisma Client Generation
- **Problem:** New models not available in types
- **Solution:** Run `npx prisma generate` after migration
- **Status:** Resolved ✅

### Date Serialization
- **Problem:** Date objects don't serialize to JSON
- **Solution:** Convert to ISO strings in format functions
- **Status:** Fixed ✅
