## What Was Deployed (Commit 623473c)

### ‚úÖ Files Successfully Committed & Pushed:
1. `UnitDetailsModal.tsx` - 391 lines of code
2. `StudentCurriculumView.tsx` - 356 lines
3. `progressApi.service.ts` - 138 lines

5. `CurriculumManagementModal.tsx` - Added publish button
6. `curriculum.types.ts` - Extended types
7. `App.tsx` - Added student route

### üîç Current Issue: Units Not Showing Real Titles

## Debugging Steps:

### 1. Check if Vercel Deployed Successfully

Go to: https://vercel.com/your-dashboard
- Check deployment timestamp
- Look for build errors
- Verify it deployed commit `623473c` or later

### 2. Check Backend Logs for AI Generation

The AI generation happens in:
- `socratit-backend/src/services/curriculumSchedule.service.ts` (line 374)
- Calls `analyzeCurriculumForScheduling()`

**Check Railway logs for:**
```
Starting AI schedule generation for schedule: <scheduleId>
AI generation completed: <result>
```

**Possible Issues:**
- Curriculum file not uploaded properly
- PDF text extraction failing
- AI API key missing/invalid
- AI generation timeout
- Response parsing error

### 3. Test the Flow Manually

#### Step-by-Step Test:
1. Create a new class
2. Upload a curriculum PDF (use a small, simple PDF for testing)
3. Go through AI generation wizard
4. Check browser console for:
   - "Creating class with data:" - Should show `generateWithAI: true`
   - "Class created successfully:" - Should show `scheduleId`
   - "Starting AI schedule generation for schedule:"
   - "AI generation completed:"

5. Navigate to class dashboard
6. Check console for:
   - "Schedule loaded:" - Should have `units` array
   - "Units found in schedule: X units"
   - "Current unit: <title>" - **This should show real title, not "Unit 1"**

### 4. Direct Database Check

If you have database access:

```sql
-- Check if schedule was created
SELECT id, title, status, "aiGenerated", "totalUnits"
FROM "CurriculumSchedule"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if units were created with real titles
SELECT id, title, description, "unitNumber", "aiGenerated"
FROM "CurriculumUnit"
WHERE "scheduleId" = '<your-schedule-id>'
ORDER BY "orderIndex";
```

**Expected:** Units should have descriptive titles like:
- "Introduction to Cellular Biology"
- "Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration"
- NOT: "Unit 1", "Unit 2"

### 5. Check Curriculum Material Upload

```sql
-- Check if curriculum was uploaded and processed
SELECT id, title, "fileName", "fileType", "extractedText"
FROM "CurriculumMaterial"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Check:**
- `extractedText` should have actual content (not empty)
- Should be > 1000 characters typically

### 6. Frontend API Call Verification

Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:
1. Navigate to class dashboard
2. Look for API call: `GET /api/v1/curriculum-schedules/class/<classId>`
3. Check response body:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": [{
       "id": "...",
       "units": [
         {
           "title": "Should be real title here",
           "description": "Should be real description",
           "topics": [...]
         }
       ]
     }]
   }
   ```

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: "Unit 1", "Unit 2" showing instead of real titles

**Cause:** AI generation failed or didn't run
**Solution:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify Gemini API key is set: `GEMINI_API_KEY=...`
3. Check curriculum file uploaded successfully
4. Try regenerating: Use "AI Assistant" in Curriculum Management Modal

### Issue 2: No units showing at all

**Cause:** Schedule not created or units array empty
**Solution:**
1. Check if `generateWithAI: true` was sent
2. Check if `scheduleId` was returned from class creation
3. Verify schedule exists in database
4. Check if AI generation endpoint was called

### Issue 3: Frontend changes not visible

**Cause:** Vercel hasn't rebuilt or cached
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check Vercel dashboard for latest deployment
4. Verify commit hash matches

### Issue 4: Can't click on units

**Cause:** Modal integration missing
**Solution:**
1. Verify `ClassDashboard.tsx` has `handleUnitClick`
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify `UnitDetailsModal` component exists

## Quick Test API Endpoint

Test if backend is working:

```bash
# Get class schedule
curl -X GET \
  'https://socratit-ai-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/curriculum-schedules/class/<classId>' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>'
```

Expected: JSON with units array containing real titles

## Files to Verify Are Deployed:

### Frontend (Vercel):
- [ ] `UnitDetailsModal.tsx` exists
- [ ] `StudentCurriculumView.tsx` exists
- [ ] `ClassDashboard.tsx` imports UnitDetailsModal
- [ ] `App.tsx` has student curriculum route
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors

### Backend (Railway):
- [ ] AI generation service working
- [ ] Gemini API key configured
- [ ] PDF text extraction working
- [ ] Curriculum schedule endpoints working

## Next Steps:

1. **Check Vercel Deployment**
   - Go to vercel.com dashboard
   - Verify latest deployment
   - Check build logs

2. **Test Class Creation**
   - Create a new class with simple curriculum
   - Watch browser console closely
   - Note any error messages

3. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to railway.app dashboard
   - Check deployment logs
   - Look for AI generation logs

4. **Report Back**
   - Share console errors
   - Share API response for schedule
   - Share Railway AI generation logs

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

‚úÖ Teacher creates class with curriculum PDF
‚úÖ AI analyzes PDF and creates units like "Introduction to Biology", "Cell Structure", etc.
‚úÖ Teacher sees units with real titles in dashboard
‚úÖ Teacher clicks unit ‚Üí Beautiful modal opens with all details
‚úÖ Teacher clicks "Publish to Students"
‚úÖ Students navigate to `/student/classes/:classId/curriculum`
‚úÖ Students see all published units
‚úÖ Students click unlocked unit ‚Üí Modal opens
