# Quick Start Guide - Testing Curriculum Features

## üéØ What You Saw in Console

```javascript
schedule: null  // ‚Üê No curriculum was created for this class
currentUnit: null
upcomingUnits: []
```

This is **EXPECTED** for your existing "Introduction to Calc 3" class because:
- It was created WITHOUT a curriculum

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No curriculum schedule created"

**Cause:** You skipped uploading a PDF

**Fix:**
- Delete the test class
- Create a new one
- **Must upload PDF in step 3**

### Issue: Console shows "AI generation failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. **No Gemini API key** in Railway backend
2. **PDF text extraction failed**
3. **AI timeout**

**What to check:**
- Railway logs for error messages
- Console error details
- Try with a different, simpler PDF

### Issue: Units still show "Unit 1", "Unit 2" generic titles

**Cause:** AI generation failed silently OR AI is returning generic titles

**Debug:**
1. Check the "AI generation completed" console log
2. Expand it and look at `units[0].title`
3. If it's generic, AI generation isn't working properly
4. Check Railway logs for AI errors

### Issue: Can't click units / modal doesn't open

**Cause:** JavaScript error or modal not rendering

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify you're on latest deployment

## üìä Expected vs Actual

### ‚ùå Your Current Class ("Introduction to Calc 3"):
```javascript
schedule: null  // No curriculum
currentUnit: null
upcomingUnits: []
```
**Reason:** Created without curriculum

### ‚úÖ New Class With Curriculum:
```javascript
schedule: {
  id: "...",
  totalUnits: 8,
  units: [
    { title: "Unit 1: Intro to Biology", ... },
    { title: "Unit 2: Cell Structure", ... },
    ...
  ]
}
currentUnit: { title: "Unit 1: Intro to Biology" }
upcomingUnits: [Unit 2, Unit 3, Unit 4]
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use a small PDF first** - 5-10 pages works best for testing
2. **Watch the console closely** - It tells you exactly what's happening
3. **Be patient** - AI generation can take 10-30 seconds
4. **Hard refresh** - If you don't see changes: Ctrl+Shift+R

---

## üìû Still Not Working?

Share with me:

1. **Full console log** from class creation (copy/paste the text)
2. **Screenshot** of what you see on the dashboard
3. **Network tab** ‚Üí Find the POST to `/api/v1/classes` ‚Üí Copy response
4. **Network tab** ‚Üí Find GET to `/api/v1/curriculum-schedules/class/:classId` ‚Üí Copy response

This will tell us exactly where it's failing!

**Bottom Line:** Your existing class has no curriculum. Create a NEW class WITH a curriculum PDF to see all the features work!
