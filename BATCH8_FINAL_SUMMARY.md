## üì¶ What Was Delivered

### ‚úÖ Backend Implementation (100% Complete)

#### 1. Database Schema
- **4 New Models Created:**
  - `StudentProgress` - Overall progress metrics per class
  - `AssignmentProgress` - Individual assignment tracking with time
  - `ConceptMasteryPath` - Teacher-customizable learning paths with prerequisites
  - `LearningVelocityLog` - Weekly velocity tracking with trend analysis

- **Model Enhancements:**
  - Updated `ConceptMastery` with 5 new progression fields
  - All models include proper indexes, relations, and multi-tenancy

- **Migration:** `20251024142227_add_progress_tracking_system` ‚úÖ Applied

#### 2. Services & Business Logic

  - Grade trend analysis with 5% threshold
  - Learning velocity calculation (weekly cron)
  - Concept mastery updates with remediation flags
  - Time tracking with 5-minute batching
  - WebSocket event emissions

#### 3. API Endpoints (20+ Endpoints)

  - `assignment:progress` - Assignment progress changed
  - `concept:mastery` - Concept mastery updated (>10% change)
  - `velocity:alert` - Velocity dropped >25% (to teachers)

#### 5. Cron Jobs
- **Weekly Velocity Calculation:**
