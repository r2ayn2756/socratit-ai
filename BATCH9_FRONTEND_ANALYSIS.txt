# BATCH 9 FRONTEND ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Current Frontend Status: PRODUCTION READY

The Socratit.ai frontend is fully functional with all core assignment management features:
- Student assignment submission with real-time auto-save
- Teacher assignment creation and grading
- Auto-grading of multiple choice questions
- Manual grade override
- Progress tracking (Batch 8)

Backend is LIVE at http://localhost:3001/api/v1

## WHAT'S MISSING FOR BATCH 9

1. FILE UPLOAD COMPONENT
   - No file input UI
   - No drag-and-drop
   - No file validation

2. CURRICULUM SERVICE
   - No upload service
   - No curriculum management UI
   - No document storage/retrieval

3. AI ASSIGNMENT MODAL
   - Button exists, modal not implemented
   - No file-to-assignment flow
   - No curriculum selection UI

## FILES TO MODIFY

CreateAssignment.tsx (567 lines)
- Add AIAssignmentModal component
- Wire "Generate with AI" button
- Show curriculum source field

TeacherAssignments.tsx (455 lines)
- Add curriculum display on assignment card
- Link to curriculum management

App.tsx
- Add curriculum management route

api.config.ts
- Add curriculum endpoints

## NEW FILES TO CREATE

src/components/common/FileUpload.tsx (NEW)
- Drag-and-drop file input
- File validation
- Progress indicator

src/services/curriculum.service.ts (NEW)
- Upload file (FormData)
- Get curriculum list
- Delete curriculum

src/components/assignment/AIAssignmentModal.tsx (NEW)
- File upload tab
- Text paste tab
- Question count/difficulty options
- Generate button

src/pages/teacher/CurriculumManagement.tsx (NEW - Optional)
- View uploaded files
- Organize by topic
- Delete with confirmation

## KEY TECHNICAL POINTS

1. HTTP CLIENT: Axios is setup with JWT auth interceptor
   - Need to handle multipart/form-data for file uploads
   - Can't use standard apiService for file uploads
   - Need FormData + fetch or custom axios config

2. REACT QUERY: All data fetching uses React Query
   - invalidateQueries() on successful mutation
   - Automatic caching and refetch
   - Perfect for curriculum list management

3. COMPONENT PATTERN: All components follow same pattern
   - TypeScript interfaces for props
   - useState for local state
   - useMutation for async operations
   - useQuery for data fetching
   - Framer Motion for animations

4. ROUTING: React Router 7.9.4 with protected routes via AuthContext
   - Teacher pages under /teacher/*
   - Student pages under /student/*
   - Admin pages under /admin/*

## IMPLEMENTATION ESTIMATE

FileUpload component:        3-4 hours
CurriculumService:           2-3 hours
AIAssignmentModal:           4-5 hours
Integration & testing:       2-3 hours
Optional CurriculumMgmt page: 4-5 hours

TOTAL: 2-3 weeks for complete Batch 9

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. Backend curriculum endpoints must be ready
2. File storage must be reliable
3. AI assignment generation must work
4. Multi-tenancy filtering is critical (teachers see only own curriculum)

## NO BREAKING CHANGES NEEDED

All changes are additive:
- New components
- New service
- New routes
- Existing code unchanged
