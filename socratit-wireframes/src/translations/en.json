  "struggles.role1": "High School Teacher",
  "struggles.quote2": "Grading is endless. District policy requires at least two grades per week per student—about 90-130 students total. I create, review, and input each manually. Paper assignments pile up. Students don't write their names, so tracking submissions becomes detective work.",
  "struggles.role2": "Middle School English Teacher",

  "struggles.quote4": "Every day's content is prescribed. There's no time to pause or reteach. Tutorials are the only option, but attendance depends on students showing up. Those who miss class need to make up multiple lessons at once, creating even more back-tracking for me.",

  "struggles.quote5": "Between passes, student arrivals, behavior issues, fire drills, active shooter drills, lockdowns, and announcements—there are constant disruptions.
