  "struggles.description": "You're not alone. These are the challenges teachers face every day.",
  "struggles.quote1": "In one day, I toggle between Schoology for lessons, TAC for grades, Outlook for communication, Review360 for behavior tracking, and Frontline for absences. None of them sync. That fragmentation is one of the biggest time-wasters in my job.",
  "struggles.role1": "High School Teacher",
  "struggles.quote2": "Grading is endless. District policy requires at least two grades per week per student—about 90-130 students total. I create, review, and input each manually. Paper assignments pile up. Students don't write their names, so tracking submissions becomes detective work.",
  "struggles.role2": "Middle School English Teacher",
  "struggles.quote3": "Tutorials were supposed to help students, but they became overwhelming. Students drop in unannounced, sometimes several at once, all needing help with different assignments. 30-minute sessions always stretch much longer. And I have to track who came and what they worked on.",
  "struggles.role3": "7th Grade Math Teacher",
  "struggles.quote4": "Every day's content is prescribed. There's no time to pause or reteach. Tutorials are the only option, but attendance depends on students showing up. Those who miss class need to make up multiple lessons at once, creating even more back-tracking for me.",
  "struggles.role4": "French Language Teacher",
  "struggles.quote5": "Between passes, student arrivals, behavior issues, fire drills, active shooter drills, lockdowns, and announcements—there are constant disruptions. Each one breaks teaching flow. I have to restart attention, re-explain material, or pause grading. It makes consistency impossible.",
  "struggles.role5": "High School Science Teacher",
  "struggles.quote6": "Some parents don't respond to emails or calls; others don't speak English. I use Outlook for emails but have to look up parent info in TAC. Sometimes there's no email listed, only a phone number. Communication often stops there. A multilingual parent-communication system integrated with grades would save significant time.",
