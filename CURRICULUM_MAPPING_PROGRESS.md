2. `curriculum_units` (25 fields + timestamps)
3. `unit_progress` (19 fields + timestamps)
4. `curriculum_milestones` (13 fields + timestamps)

### Enhanced Tables:
1. `assignments` - Added `curriculum_unit_id` field

### Total Indexes Created:
- 29 new indexes for optimal query performance
- 3 unique constraints for data integrity

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 - AI Enhancement):
1. **Enhance AI Service** (`src/services/ai.service.ts`)
   - Create `analyzeCurriculumForScheduling` method
   - Extract units with time estimates (weeks/days)
   - Analyze difficulty levels (1-5 scale)
   - Identify prerequisites and sequencing
   - Generate assessment checkpoints
   - Return structured `EnhancedAIAnalysis` interface

2. **AI Prompt Templates**
   - Design prompts for unit extraction
   - Add few-shot examples for consistent formatting
   - Include pacing guidelines based on grade level
   - Handle edge cases (insufficient content, unclear structure)

3. **Backend Service Methods**
   - `generateScheduleFromCurriculum()` - Main schedule generation
   - `refineScheduleWithAI()` - Chat-based refinement
   - `getAISuggestions()` - Proactive improvement suggestions
   - `calculateScheduleMetrics()` - Analyze schedule quality

### Phase 3 - Backend API Development:
1. **Schedule Controller** (`src/controllers/curriculumSchedule.controller.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for schedules
   - AI generation endpoint
   - Publishing workflow
   - Progress calculation

2. **Unit Controller** (`src/controllers/curriculumUnit.controller.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for units
   - Bulk reorder endpoint
   - Progress tracking per unit
   - Suggested assignments

3. **API Routes** (`src/routes/curriculum-schedule.routes.ts`, `curriculum-unit.routes.ts`)
   - RESTful endpoint definitions
   - Middleware (auth, validation, ownership)
   - Rate limiting configuration

4. **Validation Schemas** (`src/validators/curriculumSchedule.validator.ts`)
   - Schedule creation/update validation
   - Unit validation (dates, difficulty, content)
   - Joi schemas for request bodies

### Phase 4 - Frontend Foundation:
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
   npm install react-big-calendar date-fns
   npm install react-calendar-timeline
   ```

2. **TypeScript Interfaces** (`src/types/curriculum.types.ts`)
   - Match backend models
   - API request/response types
   - UI component prop types

3. **API Service** (`src/services/curriculumSchedule.service.ts`)
   - CRUD methods
   - AI generation calls
   - Progress fetching

---

## üí° Key Design Decisions

### 1. Independent Pacing Per Class
- Each class gets its own `CurriculumSchedule`
- Teachers can upload same curriculum but adjust pacing differently
- Supports Period 1 moving faster than Period 5

### 2. Flexible Unit Structure
- Units can span multiple weeks (fractional: 2.5 weeks)
- Topics are JSON (flexible structure for subtopics, concepts, objectives)
- Teacher can modify AI-generated units completely

### 3. Comprehensive Progress Tracking
- Student progress calculated per unit based on assignments
- Tracks strengths, struggles, and recommended review areas
- Links to existing ConceptMastery system

### 4. AI-Assisted but Teacher-Controlled
- AI generates initial schedule (saves hours of work)
- Teacher has full control to adjust everything
- Track what's AI-generated vs teacher-modified
- AI chat for quick refinements ("Make Unit 3 longer")

### 5. Assignment-Unit Integration
- Assignments optionally link to units
- Auto-suggest due dates based on unit schedule
- Unit progress updates when assignments graded
- Flexible (assignments can exist without units)
