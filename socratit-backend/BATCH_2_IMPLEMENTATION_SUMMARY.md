# Batch 2: Class Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete - All Features Implemented

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the **Class Management System** (Batch 2) for Socratit.ai.

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. **Database Schema Extensions**

Added **3 new models** to support class management with multi-teacher support:

#### **Class Model**
- Represents a class/course
- Fields: name, subject, gradeLevel, academicYear, period, room, scheduleTime, color
- **Unique class code** with format `XXX-1234` (3 letters, hyphen, 4 numbers)
- Optional code expiration (`codeExpiresAt`)
- Active/inactive status for soft archival
- Multi-tenancy via `schoolId`
- Soft delete support (`deletedAt`)

#### **ClassTeacher Model** (Junction Table)
- **Many-to-many** relationship between classes and teachers
- Supports **multiple teachers per class** (co-teaching)
- `isPrimary` flag to designate primary teacher vs. co-teachers
- Allows future expansion for co-teaching scenarios

#### **ClassEnrollment Model**
- Manages student enrollments with **approval workflow**
- Status: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `REMOVED`
- Tracks who processed the enrollment (`processedBy`, `processedAt`)
- Optional rejection reason for transparency
- Unique constraint: one enrollment per student per class

### 2. **API Endpoints Implemented**

#### **Teacher Class Management** (`/api/v1/classes`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| `/` | POST | Create new class with auto-generated code | Teacher |
| `/` | GET | Get all teacher's classes with stats | Teacher |
| `/:classId` | GET | Get class details | Teacher/Student (enrolled) |
| `/:classId` | PATCH | Update class details | Teacher (owner) |
| `/:classId` | DELETE | Soft delete class | Teacher (owner) |
| `/:classId/regenerate-code` | POST | Generate new class code | Teacher (owner) |

#### **Enrollment Management** (`/api/v1/classes/:classId/enrollments`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| `/` | GET | Get class roster (all enrollments) | Teacher (owner) |
| `/` | POST | Manually add students (auto-approved) | Teacher (owner) |
| `/:enrollmentId` | PATCH | Approve/reject/remove enrollment | Teacher (owner) |
| `/:enrollmentId` | DELETE | Remove student from class | Teacher (owner) |

#### **Student Self-Enrollment** (`/api/v1/enrollments`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| `/` | POST | Enroll with class code | Student |
| `/` | GET | Get all my enrollments | Student |
| `/:enrollmentId` | GET | Get enrollment details | Student/Teacher |

### 3. **Business Logic Workflows**

#### **Student Self-Enrollment Flow**
1. Student enters class code
2. System validates code format (`XXX-1234`)
3. System checks code exists, is active, and not expired
4. System verifies student and class are in same school (multi-tenancy)
5. System checks for duplicate enrollment
6. Creates enrollment with status = `PENDING`
7. **Notifies all teachers** of the class about new request
8. Logs audit event

#### **Teacher Approval Flow**
1. Teacher views pending enrollments
2. Teacher clicks Approve/Reject
3. System updates enrollment status
4. Sets `processedAt` and `processedBy`
5. **Notifies student** of decision
6. Logs audit event
7. If approved, student gains immediate access to class

#### **Manual Student Add Flow**
1. Teacher enters list of student emails
2. System validates all emails exist and are students in same school
3. Creates enrollments with status = `APPROVED` (auto-approved)
4. **Notifies each student** they were added
5. Logs audit event for each student
6. Students immediately see class in their dashboard

#### **Class Code Generation**
- Format: `ABC-1234` (3 letters, hyphen, 4 numbers)
- Excludes ambiguous characters: O, I, L (to avoid confusion with 0, 1)
- Uniqueness guaranteed (retry up to 5 times)
- Can be regenerated to invalidate old code

### 4. **Security Implementation**

✅ **Multi-Tenancy Enforcement**
- All queries filtered by `schoolId`
- Students cannot enroll in classes from other schools
- Teachers cannot see classes from other schools
- Cross-school access completely prevented

✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- Teachers: Can only manage their own classes
- Students: Can only view enrolled classes with APPROVED status
- Removed students see classes but marked as inactive

✅ **Authorization Middleware**
- `requireClassTeacher`: Verifies teacher teaches the class
- `requireClassAccess`: Verifies teacher teaches OR student is enrolled
- `requireEnrollmentAccess`: Verifies enrollment ownership

✅ **Audit Logging**
- All class creation/updates logged
- All enrollment actions logged (request, approve, reject, remove)
- Teacher ID tracked for approval/rejection actions
- Complete audit trail for FERPA/COPPA compliance

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- Class creation: 20/hour per teacher
- Class code operations: 10/minute
- Enrollment requests: 5/minute per student

### 5. **Utilities & Services**

#### **Token Generation** (`utils/token.ts`)
- `generateClassCode()`: Creates `XXX-1234` format codes
- Excludes ambiguous characters for easy verbal sharing
- Ensures uniqueness via database check

#### **Validation** (`utils/validation.ts`)
- `isValidClassCodeFormat()`: Regex validation for code format
- `validateClassCode()`: Comprehensive code validation (format, existence, expiration, active status)
- `isClassTeacher()`: Check if user teaches a class
- `isStudentEnrolled()`: Check if student is enrolled with APPROVED status

#### **Notification Service** (`services/notification.service.ts`)
- **Basic version** for Batch 2 (console logging)
- Sends notifications for:
  - Enrollment requests (to teachers)
  - Enrollment approved/rejected (to students)
  - Manually added to class (to students)
  - Removed from class (to students)
- Ready for WebSocket integration in Batch 6

### 6. **Data Validation**

#### **Class Validation** (`validators/class.validator.ts`)
- **Create**: name (required), academicYear (required, format: YYYY-YYYY), optional fields
- **Update**: At least one field required, all optional
- Academic year must match format `2024-2025`
- Color must be `blue`, `purple`, or `orange`

#### **Enrollment Validation** (`validators/enrollment.validator.ts`)
- **Enroll with code**: Code format `XXX-1234`
- **Add students**: 1-50 student emails, valid email format
- **Process enrollment**: Status must be APPROVED/REJECTED/REMOVED
- Rejection reason required if status = REJECTED

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Multiple Teachers per Class**
- Used junction table `ClassTeacher` to support co-teaching
- `isPrimary` flag allows distinguishing primary teacher from assistants
- Enables future features like teaching assistant roles

### 2. **Class Code Format: `XXX-1234`**
- Easy to communicate verbally
- Short enough to type quickly
- Hyphen makes it clear to read
- Excludes ambiguous characters (O→0, I/L→1)

### 3. **Pending Enrollment Until Teacher Acts**
- No automatic approval
- No expiration on pending requests
- Teacher has full control over class roster
- Aligns with classroom management best practices

### 4. **Students See Removed Classes**
- Removed classes visible in student's "past classes" or filtered view
- Provides continuity for grade history
- Supports use cases where students reference old materials

### 5. **Code Expiration is Optional**
- Teachers can set expiration if needed (e.g., enrollment window)
- Most classes don't need expiration
- Flexible for different teaching scenarios
