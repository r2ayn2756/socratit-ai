--- Lines 79-191 (curriculum schedule creation logic) should be replaced with:

    // Note: Curriculum files are just stored as references in curriculumMaterialId
    // No automatic curriculum schedule creation - teachers will create schedules manually
    console.log('[DEBUG] Class created. Curriculum file reference:', body.curriculumMaterialId || 'none');

--- Lines 227-234 (response with scheduleId) should be replaced with:

    const response: ApiResponse = {
      success: true,
      data: classWithTeachers,
      message: 'Class created successfully',
    };

    res.status(201).json(response);
